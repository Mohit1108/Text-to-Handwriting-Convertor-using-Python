# Text-to-Handwriting-Convertor-using-Python
Since Python is a popular and open source programming language, it provides libraries for almost any task you can think of. To convert text to handwriting, there is a library known as Pywhatkit in Python. It provides many useful functions, but the function that interests me the most is converting the text of a user input to handwritten text. If youâ€™ve never used it before, you can easily install it on your system using the pip command.
